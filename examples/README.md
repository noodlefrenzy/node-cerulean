Azure Examples
==============

I've found that several common tasks using the Azure API can be difficult to figure out, or are just not totally clear. This directory is meant to contain clean examples for how to do some of those simple tasks. Feel free to add more as you find them.

## Examples

* `servicebus_send_receive`: Simple example of creating a queue and then polling for new messages, using peek-lock and delete.
